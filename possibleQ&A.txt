Possible panelist questions and strong answers
•	Architecture / Design
o	Q: "Why a backend instead of direct client calls to the weather API?"
o	A: "To protect API keys, centralize rate-limiting and data shaping, and add caching; the server is minimal but enables these concerns."
•	
Security
o	Q: "How do you protect API keys and user data?"
o	A: "API keys are stored server-side (not in index.html). We restrict external exposure by only exposing the necessary endpoints and would add HTTPS and env-based secrets for production."
•
Scalability & Performance
o	Q: "How does this scale under load?"
o	A: "Right now it's single-process Node; for scale we’d add caching (in-memory or Redis), a rate-limit layer, and horizontal scaling behind a load balancer."

Reliability / Fault Tolerance
o	Q: "What happens when the external weather API is down?"
o	A: "We’d serve cached recent data and present a degraded UI message. For the demo, we prepared a static fallback fixture."

Testing
o	Q: "What tests exist?"
o	A: "Currently manual verification and basic dev checks; next steps include unit tests for api/index.js, integration tests for endpoints, and end-to-end UI tests with Playwright or Cypress."

Privacy & Compliance
o	Q: "Do you store user locations?"
o	A: "No persistent storage is used in the demo; searches are transient. If we collected location data, we'd add opt-in and a retention policy."

Extensibility / Roadmap
o	Q: "What features would you prioritize next?"
o	A: "1) Robust caching and rate-limit handling, 
    2) automated tests + CI, 
    3) mobile responsive improvements, 
    4) optional hourly forecast and user preferences."

Implementation specifics
o	Q: "Which file routes handle the API and where are they documented?"
o	A: "api/index.js contains the route logic and swagger.json documents the endpoints for external devs."

Metrics & Monitoring
o	Q: "How will you monitor this in production?"
o	A: "Add logs (structured), use health checks, and integrate APM (e.g. New Relic) and error tracking (Sentry) to capture issues."

Presentation tips and logistics
•	Timing: 60–90 seconds per content slide; reserve 2–3 minutes for the live demo as the highlight.
•	Visuals: Use the architecture diagram and 1–2 screenshots (UI + Network tab). Keep slides uncluttered.
•	Live demo advice: Practice the exact clicks 2–3 times; prepare a recorded gif in case networking fails.
•	Handling tough questions: If unsure, say "I don't have that data yet; my plan is X" and offer a specific follow-up (e.g., "I can run a throughput test and share results afterwards").

Optional deliverables I can create next
•	A minimal slide deck (PowerPoint or Markdown slides).
•	A one-page cheat-sheet of Q&A you can keep during the panel.
•	A short recorded demo GIF for fallback.
Would you like me to:
•	(A) Draft the slide-by-slide talking points now,
•	(B) Generate the one-page Q&A cheat-sheet, or
•	(C) create the minimal slide deck?
